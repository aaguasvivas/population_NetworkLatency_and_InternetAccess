# Who Gets Access to Reliable Connections? Visualizing and Exploring the Relationship Between Population and Network Latency.

## About the Project

**[Access the website here: ](aaguasvivas.github.io)** [aaguasvivas.github.io](aaguasvivas.github.io)

This was a final project for Harvard's CS143 course in fall 2020. It was created by Adelson Aguasvivas, Madison Harris, Dominic Garrity, and Santy Mendoza.

The purpose of this project was to visualize and explore the relationship between population and network latency. We hypothesized that servers in more populous areas would have faster ping times. To test our hypothesis we pinged servers in both rural and urban areas. We also created a satellite simulation to determine whether gobal internet access is hypothetically posssible. The results revealed that ping times to rural towns are longer than those to major cities and that full internet connectivity is hypothetically possible with a low orbit satellite constellation which could help alleviate the internet access disparity between urban and rural communities in the US and internationally.

### Built With

This project is a culmination of all of the work and research we did for our class, CS143: Computer Networks at Harvard University. The major programming languages and frameworks we used include:

- [AGIâ€™s Systems Tool Kit](https://www.agi.com/products/stk)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

If you want to view the project, you can do so by visiting [this website](aaguasvivas.github.io): https://aaguasvivas.github.io/

If you want to set up your own local version, follow the steps below where we outline an example of the software needed, how to install it, important commands and how to get things running.

### Prerequisites

First, we will need an IDE. We personally used WebStorm to develop the website because it is a very powerful IDE for JavaScript, providing you with several features, such as code completion, error handling, and a quick and intuitive way to get your index.html up and running. We have also included the spreadsheet of all of the data we have collected and the Python scripts for the satellite constellation.

- [WebStorm by JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)
