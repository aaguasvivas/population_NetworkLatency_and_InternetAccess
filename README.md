This was a final project for Harvard's CS143 course in fall 2020. It was created by Adelson Aguasvivas, Madison Harris, Dominic Garrity, and Santy Mendoza.

The purpose of this project was to visualize and explore the relationship between population and network latency. We hypothesized that servers in more populous areas would have faster ping times. To test our hypothesis we pinged servers in both rural and urban areas. We also created a satellite simulation to determine whether gobal internet access is hypothetically posssible. The results revealed that ping times to rural towns are longer than those to major cities and that full internet connectivity is hypothetically possible with a low orbit satellite constellation which could help alleviate the internet access disparity between urban and rural communities in the US and internationally.
