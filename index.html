                        The goal of this project is to explore the relationship between population, connection speeds,

                        Round Trip Time (RTT) is the amount of time it takes for a signal to be sent,
                        plus the amount of time that it takes for that signal to be acknowledged.
                        RTT is an important measure of network reliability, and focusing on population size will
                        allow us to determine where network infrastructure can be improved.
