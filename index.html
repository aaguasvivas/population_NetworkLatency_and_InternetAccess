                        Round Trip Time (RTT) is the amount of time it takes for a signal to be sent,
                        plus the amount of time that it takes for that signal to be acknowledged.
                        RTT is an important measure of network reliability, and focusing on population size will
                        allow us to determine where network infrastructure can be improved.

                    From the late 1990s to 2002, Netflix grew from a small privately
                    owned online movie rental business to a
                    publicly traded multi-million dollar company.
                    Now, it is a household name making billions of
                    dollars in revenue every year while still seeing exponential
                    growth.
                    <br>
                    Netflix continuously evolved its successful model,
                    survived a recession, and emerged as a revolutionizing force in the entertainment
                    industry. With the world becoming more and more
                    digitized amidst a pandemic, Netflix can expect to continue
                    its yearly growth in subscribers and revenue.

                    successful,

                    online
                    streaming has surged in popularity during the 2020 quarantine, Netflix continues to stand out
