                        In an increasingly virtual world, streaming platforms for movies and TV shows have become more
                        and
                        more popular amongst consumers. People have opted to stream from their personal devices instead
                        of
                        watching entertainment on live cable or in theaters.
                        Since the year after its inception in 1997, Netflix offered online movie rentals in which
                        customers
                        would receive their DVD in the mail. However, by the end of 2010, Netflix users were streaming
                        their
                        entertainment at a far greater pace than those renting, and Netflix became a solely online
                        streaming
                        platform. As it developed its streaming services and expanded outside of the United States,
                        Netflix
                        has become a staple of modern entertainment. Not only is it the go-to platform for most users,
                        but
                        Netflix has become a cultural icon for current generations.
                        Despite increasing competition as rivals enter the streaming space, Netflix continues to come
                        out on
                        top. Let's analyze Netflix's astounding success in an increasingly competitive landscape.</h4>

                    From the late 1990s to 2002, Netflix grew from a small privately
                    owned online movie rental business to a
                    publicly traded multi-million dollar company.
                    Now, it is a household name making billions of
                    dollars in revenue every year while still seeing exponential

                    Netflix continuously evolved its successful model,
